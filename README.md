This program's menu has these options:

# Komodo Insurance Badges
This menu is quite similar to the previous two:
<ol>
 <li>Display Badges</li>
 <li>Create New Badges</li>
 <li>Update Badges</li>
 <li>Exit</li>
</ol>

Display, Create, and Exit have the same functionality as the previous two programs.
Update puts the user into a secondary menu, after prompting the user to select a badge.
<ol>
 <li>Add Doors</li>
 <li>Remove Doors</li>
 <li>Exit</li>
</ol>

Add Doors allows the user to add a single, or many, doors, to the "working" badge.
Remove Doors allows the user to remove a single, or many, doors, from the "working" badge.
Exit exits to the previous menu.
